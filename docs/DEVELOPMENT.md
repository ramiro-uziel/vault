# Build from source

Requires Go 1.23+ and Bun.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramiro-uziel/vault
cd vault
cp .env.example .env
make build
./server
```

# Development

Requires Go 1.23+, Bun, and [wgo](https://github.com/bokwoon95/wgo) for live reload.

```bash
# Install wgo
go install github.com/bokwoon95/wgo@latest

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && bun install && cd ..

cp .env.example .env
make dev
```

This starts the backend with live reload and the frontend dev server concurrently.

## Backend

Go application rooted at `internal/`. The entry point is `cmd/server/main.go`. Database queries are written in SQL under `internal/db/queries/` and compiled with [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev). Migrations live in `migrations/`.

## Frontend

React app under `frontend/`. Uses Bun as the package manager. Built with Vite, Tanstack Router, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.
